# Test your Arduino Component
ArduinoComponentTest.ino is a little template to create a script that may helps you to test the functionality and wiring of Arduino components in your DIY projects. <br>
This file wont't compile straight away, thus the script requires  your attention.

## Idea & Concept:
Wirirng circuits often comes with the try&error principle. 
Therefore, having a .ino template is helfful to make get your wiring right.

## Project Status: 
Done.

## Built with:
C++ - Arduino IDE
